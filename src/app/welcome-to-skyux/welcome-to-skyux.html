  “Bark Back” is a fictional animal shelter that demonstrates using SKY UX components to build a web
  application. The application includes a list of animals that are available for adoption. The
  application allows users to view details about each animal, add new animals, and edit or delete
  existing animals. The application also includes a hub page that provides quick access to related
  links and important information.
